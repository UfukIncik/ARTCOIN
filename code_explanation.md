The identity verification processes have changed significantly as the digital age has advanced so quickly. 
Concerns about identity theft and data security have been raised due to the limitations of traditional identity verification techniques. 
Blockchain technology, on the other hand, provides a novel solution to these problems by making identity verification secure, real, and efficient. 
The blockchain-based identity verification system will be covered in this article, along with its potential advantages.

An innovative method of identity verification is provided by blockchain. 
Traditional methods rely on centralized databases, but a blockchain-based system distributes data storage, protecting identity data. 
The fundamental elements and operation of a blockchain-based identity verification system are as follows: identity data and digital signatures, decentralized validation and consensus, immutable audit trail.
If you wish, let's move on to the steps of the blockchain-based identification application we developed as senior students at Akdeniz University.
In order for our code to work properly, we had to include some packages in the project. These were packages jsrsasign, crytpo-js and elliptic. You can include these packages in your projects as npm install <package_name>.
We first started developing the project from the blockchain.js file. In this file we have defined the constructors of the 'Block', 'Blockchain' and 'Transaction' classes. We wanted the blockchain we created to work with a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. That's why we have the 'mineBlock()' function inside our 'Block' class.

We also used Sha256 to ensure that each of our blocks is unique.
